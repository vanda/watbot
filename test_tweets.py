             The shuttle Discovery, already delayed three times by technical problems
             and bad weather, was grounded again Friday, this time by a potentially
             dangerous gaseous hydrogen leak in a vent line attached to the ships
             external tank. The Discovery was initially scheduled to make its 39th
             and final flight last Monday, bearing fresh supplies and an intelligent
             robot for the International Space Station. But complications delayed the
             flight from Monday to Friday,  when the hydrogen leak led NASA to conclude
             that the shuttle would not be ready to launch before its flight window
             closed this Monday. """
